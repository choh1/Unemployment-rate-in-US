Unemployment rate in US


By September 2020, the unemployment rate declined to 7.9 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The pandemic is still far from being controlled and many companies announced plans for cut jobs or long-term remote works. 

This project was aimed to visually demonstrate the rate of unemployment as well as those that are not in labor force. Both data used dates from year 1992 to 2020.
